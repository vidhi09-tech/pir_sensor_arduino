detecting motion
A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors. PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications.
The output of PIR motion detection sensor can be connected directly to one of the Arduino (or any microcontroller) digital pins. If any motion is detected by the sensor, this pin value will be set to “1”. The two potentiometers on the board allow you to adjust the sensitivity and delay time after detecting a movement.
